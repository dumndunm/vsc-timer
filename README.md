# Timer
Extension to keep track of your time ⏱.

Feel free to submit any issues you may have via the issue tracker.

## Installation

When identifying an extension, provide the full name of the form `publisher.timer`.
See Extension Marketplace for more information on the multiple ways of installing VSCode extensions.

## How it works

This extension is activated with a keyboard shortcut [`Ctrl+Shift+T`], or by typing the word `"timer"` into the command palette, which is called by a key combination [`Shift+Cmd+P`].

When extension is launched, enter needed time value in the format `"5s"`, where `"s"` is considered as seconds, or `"10m"`, where `"m"` stands for minutes, or `"2h"`, where `"h"` contemplates hours, and press `“Enter”`.

When activated, [`Ctrl+Shift+T`] may be called again to see what actions can be performed, e.g. `stop`, `pause` and `restart`.

**Enjoy!**
